# Homework 1: Building Blocks

## Problem 1

### Installing Packages Needed

This downloads the **early_january_weather** dataset from the
**moderndive** library

``` r
library('moderndive') 
data("early_january_weather")
```

### Describing the Dataset

The **early_january_weather** dataset has 358 observations and is
composed of 15 variables/columns. The columns are as following:  
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.

Notable important variables include the **year range** (2013, 2013),
**mean temperature** (39.5821229), and the **mean wind speed**
(8.2258269).

### Making the Scaterplot

The scatterplot below shows the relationship between **time (hours)**
and **temperature**. We will use tidyverse to make the scatterplot.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
    ## ✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5
    ## ✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1
    ## ✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.2.1
    ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1
    ## ✔ purrr     1.0.2     
    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
    ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors

``` r
ggplot(
  data = early_january_weather,
  mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Describing The Scatterplot

This scatterplot shows time acrross a couple of weeks in Janurary.
Temperatures ranged from 24.08 to 57.92 degrees Fahrenheit. The color
gradient represents humidity levels, with lighter colors indicating
higher humidity. There is an increase in temperature during as Janurary
progresses. It also appears that higher temperatures also have higher
himidity levels.

### Saving the Scatterplot

``` r
ggsave("p8105_hw1_kg3006_scatterplot.png")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

## Problem 2

In this problem we will create a dataframe ourselves and analyze it.

### Creating the Dataframe

``` r
hw1 <- tibble(
  size = rnorm(10, sd = 1), # 10 observatoins created 
  size_greater_than_0 = size > 0, # True if size is greater than 0 
  book_character = c("Alice", "Max", "Kevin", "Jose", "Hannah", "Mirna", "Sam", "Mia", "Omar", "Edwin"),
  occupation = as.factor(c("Doctor", "Professor", "Nurse", "Doctor", "Professor",   "Nurse", "Doctor", "Professor", "Nurse", "Doctor"))) #factor with 3 variables 
```

### Taking the mean of each variable

#### Size

We will take the mean of the varibles using the pull function.

``` r
 hw1 %>% 
  pull(size) %>% 
  mean()
```

    ## [1] -0.07778482

The mean for the **size** variable is -0.0777848. This function works.

#### Logical variable

Taking the mean of the logical variable **size_greater_than_0**.

``` r
 hw1 %>% 
  pull(size_greater_than_0) %>% 
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.4

This also works. The mean here is 0.4. However, since this is treating
False as 0 and True as 1 and there are only 10 samples, then the 0.1
means that 1 person is coded as 1 and the rest are coded as 0.

#### Book characters

Taking the mean of the **book_character** variable.

``` r
 hw1 %>% 
  pull(book_character) %>% 
  mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Taking the mean of a character variable does not work.

#### Occupation

Taking the mean of the **occupation** variable.

``` r
 hw1 %>% 
  pull(occupation) %>% 
  mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

This also does not work for factor variables.
