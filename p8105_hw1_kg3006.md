# Homework 1: Building Blocks

## Problem 1

### Installing Packages Needed

This downloads the **early_january_weather** dataset from the
**moderndive** library

``` r
library('moderndive') 
data("early_january_weather")
```

### Describing the Dataset

The **early_january_weather** dataset has 358 observations and is
composed of 15 variables/columns. The columns are as following:  
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.

Notable important variables include the **year range** (2013, 2013),
**mean temperature** (39.5821229), and the **mean wind speed**
(8.2258269).

### Making the Scaterplot

The scatterplot below shows the relationship between **time (hours)**
and **temperature**. We will use tidyverse to make the scatterplot.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
    ## ✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5
    ## ✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1
    ## ✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.2.1
    ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1
    ## ✔ purrr     1.0.2     
    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
    ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors

``` r
ggplot(
  data = early_january_weather,
  mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Describing The Scatterplot

This scatterplot shows time acrross a couple of weeks in Janurary.
Temperatures ranged from 24.08 to 57.92 degrees Fahrenheit. The color
gradient represents humidity levels, with lighter colors indicating
higher humidity. There is an increase in temperature during as Janurary
progresses. It also appears that higher temperatures also have higher
himidity levels.

### Saving the Scatterplot

``` r
ggsave("p8105_hw1_kg3006_scatterplot.png")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

## Problem 2

In this problem we will create a dataframe ourselves and analyze it.

### Creating the Dataframe

``` r
hw1 <- tibble(
  size = rnorm(10, sd = 1), # 10 observatoins created 
  greater_than_0 = size > 0, # True if size is greater than 0 
  book_character = c("Alice", "Max", "Kevin", "Jose", "Hannah", "Mirna", "Sam", "Mia", "Omar", "Edwin"),
  occupation = as.factor(c("Doctor", "Professor", "Nurse", "Doctor", "Professor",   "Nurse", "Doctor", "Professor", "Nurse", "Doctor"))) #factor with 3 variables 
```

### Taking the mean of each variable

We will take the mean of the varibles using the pull function.

``` r
 hw1 %>% 
  pull(size) %>% 
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.5931428

The mean for the **size** variable is 0.5931428. This function works.
