# Homework 1: Building Blocks 
## Problem 1 
### Installing Packages Needed 
This downloads the **early_january_weather** dataset from the **moderndive** library

```{r}
library('moderndive') 
data("early_january_weather")
```

The **early_january_weather** dataset has `r nrow(early_january_weather)` observations and is composed of `r ncol(early_january_weather)` variables/columns. The columns are as following:  
  `r paste(names(early_january_weather), collapse = ", ")`. 
  
Notable important variables include the **year range** (`r range(early_january_weather$year)`), **mean temperature** (`r mean(early_january_weather$temp)`), and the **mean wind speed** (`r mean(early_january_weather$wind_speed)`).
